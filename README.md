Introduction
This project utilizes TensorFlow to build and train a CNN model for image classification. The dataset consists of images categorized into various classes. The trained model can predict the class of an input image with a certain level of accuracy.

Usage
To use the image classifier:

Clone this repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-classifier.git
Install the required dependencies:
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Prepare your dataset by organizing images into separate directories based on their classes.

Run the main script:

css
Copy code
python main.py
This will load the dataset, preprocess it, train the model, evaluate its performance, and save the trained model.

Dataset
The dataset should be organized into separate directories, each representing a class. The load_and_preprocess_dataset function loads the dataset from the specified directory, preprocesses it, and splits it into training, validation, and testing sets.

Training
The train_model function builds and trains the CNN model using TensorFlow's Keras API. The model architecture consists of convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers and fully connected layers. The training process is monitored using TensorBoard.

Evaluation
The evaluate_model function evaluates the trained model's performance on the testing dataset, providing metrics such as loss and accuracy.

Model Saving
After training, the trained model is saved in the models directory as trained_model.h5.

Dependencies
TensorFlow
OpenCV
Matplotlib
NumPy
